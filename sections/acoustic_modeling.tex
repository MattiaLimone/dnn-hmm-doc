\section{Acoustic modeling}\label{sec:acoustic_modeling}
The first step in the DNN-HMM methodology for SI is speaker acoustic modeling, which has been approached with a historically appreciated technique: GMM-HMM (Gaussian-Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model).

Other acoustic modeling approaches include segmental models \cite{am:segmental}, maximum entropy models~\cite{am:entropy}, and (hidden) conditional random fields \cite{am:randomfields}.

Before diving into acoustic modeling for DNN-HMM, let's introduce the statistical concepts GMM-HMM is based on.
