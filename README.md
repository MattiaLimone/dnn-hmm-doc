# DNN-HMM Document

This repository contains the latex files to generate the document describing our work.

## Recommendations

The `preamble` already contains the most used packages that are usually needed, so before adding a new one check that it isn't already there.

If you add a new package, **do not** insert it after `hyperref`, it needs to be the last one, and check for dependencies issues.
